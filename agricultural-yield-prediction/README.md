# Agricultural Yield Prediction Project

This project aims to predict agricultural yield using various machine learning models. The dataset used for training and evaluation is based on crop yield data, which includes multiple features related to agricultural practices and environmental conditions.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluating the models.
  - `crop_yield.csv`: The dataset with features related to agricultural yield.
  
- **models/**: Implements different machine learning models for yield prediction.
  - `linear_regression.py`: Contains the implementation of the linear regression model.
  - `logistic_regression.py`: Implements the logistic regression model for classification tasks.
  - `model_comparison.py`: Functions to compare the performance of different models.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
  - `agricultural_yield.ipynb`: Contains EDA, data preprocessing, and visualizations.

- **src/**: Source code for data processing and model training.
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Functions for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
  - `feature_engineering.py`: Functions for creating new features to enhance model performance.
  - `hyperparameter_optimization.py`: Techniques for optimizing model hyperparameters.
  - `model_training.py`: Main logic for training the models.

- **results/**: Stores evaluation metrics and analysis of the trained models.
  - `model_metrics.json`: JSON file with evaluation metrics of the trained models.
  - `training_analysis.md`: Detailed analysis of the training results.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Place the dataset `crop_yield.csv` in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

- Use the Jupyter notebook `agricultural_yield.ipynb` for exploratory data analysis and to visualize the dataset.
- Run the scripts in the `src/` directory to preprocess the data, engineer features, optimize hyperparameters, and train the models.
- Evaluate the models using the functions in `models/model_comparison.py` to compare their performance.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting agricultural yield using machine learning techniques. The models implemented can be further refined and optimized based on the insights gained from the analysis.
